## Version Control System

VCS is an abbreviation for Version Control System. A VCS is a tool that saves the changes to files in a local and/or remote repository. The benefit of using a VCS is the clear development history – at any point in time it is possible to see who did what and what happened since then. This clear development history makes it easier to locate bugs and roll back to stable versions.

## Alternatives to Git

Are there any alternatives to using a VCS? Not really – one could use local backups on (removable) hard drives, but this makes working together much harder. Git is the most popular VCS worldwide, mostly because of its ease of use and speed – because you work locally you’re not as limited by network speed, there is no single point of failure as with centralized VCS(SVN) and git is available offline.

Alternatives to Git include Mercurial and SVN, but only about 16.1% of developers use SVN, and only 3.6% use Mercurial while 80-90% of developers use Git: [https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-tools-tech-love-dread](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-tools-tech-love-dread).

Another important thing to note with these statistics is that many developers don't use just one system - they will often use different systems profesionally than personally.

## Distributed versus centralized VCS

Git is a distributed VCS, meaning that you always have a working local repository in addition to a central remote. Centralized VCS only have a remote, so any ‘commits’ you make are sent directly to the remote.

## Git versus GitHub: Git as a service

GitHub and Git are often used interchangably, but GitHub ‘merely’ hosts Git as a service. There are alternative hosts, such as GitLab, BitBucket, Sourceforge or hosting your own, but GitHub is the most popular provider. However, its market share has decreased a little ever since it got taken over by Microsoft.

If you decide to use a different host (although we recommend GitHub at this point in time) it is important to note that Git will work the same for every host you choose. It is the host's specific infrastructure and functionality that can be different, but the underlying Git functionality remains the same.

## Git from the command line

You can use Git integrated through your IDE or with a GUI, but this presents several problems; they may be linked to specific languages (JetBrains), may not always be available (problems with software) and as a developer you're never fully sure what actually happens when using these tools.

As a software developer it’s important to select the right tools for the job, but Git through command line is always a good tool to have: you can always use it, you have full control and you are not limited to a specific environment.

Example; 1st year students have learned to use Git through JetBrains IDEs, but not manually. For a project they did they had to work with the Arduino IDE, which does not have a native git integration. They said they kept copy+pasting code from Arduino IDE to Clion in order to use the Git integration.

## Using Git

### Creating a repository

There are a few ways of making a new repository. The easiest is by making one on GitHub, or your host of choice, and cloning that to a local repository. This is easiest, because it allows you to initiate with a readme, a gitignore and a license. It also makes it easy for your clone of this repo to find the remote when making your first commit from your local repository. You can then simply clone the remote to make a local copy. It is also possible to initiate a new repo locally and then set its remote using `git remote add <REPO NAME> <REPO SSH/URL>` . This feels like more work though, and if you want a remote anyway it’s easier to start by making the remote.

### Clone versus Fork

Cloning and Forking both create copies of a repository, but with different intents. Forking makes an unlinked remote copy, whereas cloning makes a linked local copy. In a forked repo you can contribute changes without affecting the original (this is where the term unlinked comes from), but a clone can’t do this - because the repositories are linked any pushes will also update the remote. You can, of course, combine the two -> Fork first to make your own remote (unlinked) copy, and then clone to work on the project locally.

### Basic workflow

`git status`: Shows tracked files that have changed and new files that aren’t tracked yet. Additionally; `git diff``: Shows changes within files

`git log --all --graph`: shows the commit history in the form of a graph

`git add`: Allows to add new files to the staging area; can be new files or tracked files that have changed

`git add` has a lot of flags/commands you can use to make using it easier (such as `git add .` or `git add -a`), but usually it’s neater to use filenames directly -> `git add <filename1> <filename2>`: this way you keep full control of what happens.

> See <https://stackoverflow.com/a/26039014>  
> Using these flags is generally discouraged, but if you **do** use them at least make sure you know what they do exactly.

`git restore`: Allows for removal of staged files from staging area -> `git restore <filename>`

Instead of `git add` you can also choose to use `git stage`. If that is the syntax you choose, you would also use `git unstage` instead of `git restore`. Both versions are identical.

`git commit`: ‘Saves’ staging area to local repository. Use the –m flag to add a commit message. Another –m can be used for a more detailed description -> `git commit –m “COMMIT MESSAGE” –m “MORE DETAILS”`. The first –m is ‘required’ (not adding it opens a text editor to type it instead), the second is optional.

There is also `git push` to push your commits to the linked remote repo, but this is further explained in the branching segment.

## Branching

A branch is a copy of the main codebase, where one can introduce changes without changing the main codebase. These are used so developers can work on new features, fixes, etc. in parallel without changing the main codebase until whatever is worked on in the branch is complete. Properly using branches prevents merge conflicts.

![branch](../git/img/Revision_controlled_project_visualization-2010-24-02.svg)

**Merge conflicts** should be avoided if possible. They occur when conflicting versions of files exist (someone else changed a file that you also changed) when either pulling to your local repo or pushing to the remote. A proper Git Workflow with proper use of a Branching Strategy prevents most merge conflicts.

### Branching strategies

There are a few different strategies development teams use for branching, but the most common is branching based on features. In this strategy, a team usually starts off with a main branch – this is the release branch. This branch only contains working code ready for release. From the main branch a development branch is created – this is where complete code is ‘staged’ until it is ready to be released. From this development branch developers create new branches for each new feature, including potential branches for bug fixes etc. If an agile project is properly set up (task division etc.), this is very easy to do.

### Branch how?

Making new branches or switching to existing branches can be done using the `git checkout` commands. Adding the `-b` flag allows for making a new branch as such; `git checkout –b “new_branch_name”` (quotes aren’t necessary, but some developers prefer using them). If you leave out the –b flag you change to an existing branch instead -> `git checkout “dev”` would switch to the ‘dev’ branch.

Do note that, alternatively, you can use the `git branch "new_branch_name"` command to make a new branch. This accomplishes the same as `git checkout`, but leaves you on your current branch. You can then use `git switch "new_branch_name"` to switch to that branch (similar to checkout).

### Branch 'Workflow'

Working with branches introduces a few new commands:

```bash
git checkout "branch-name"
# Checkout is used for switching branches. Examples:
git checkout main
git checkout my-local-work-branch
# By adding the -b flag you can make a new branch:
git checkout -b "my-new-branch-name"
```

```bash
git pull 
# Pulls changes from the remote to your local repository.
# If you use this in a specific branch only the changes from the remote to that branch are pulled.
# For example, if the dev branch has been changed but you pull a different feature branch, you don’t pull the changes from the dev branch:
git pull different-feature-branch
# ...will copy any changes for that branch from the server into your local repository.
```

```bash
git push 
# Pushes your local commits to the branch you are in to the corresponding branch on the remote.
# Similar to pull, this only works for the specific branch you are on.
```

```bash
git merge "some-other-branch" 
# Merges ‘some-other-branch’ into the branch you are currently in.
# Merging can create merge conflicts, so using it properly requires a merging strategy.
```

### Merging workflow

First, make sure the branch you want to merge into (destination) is up to date by switching to that branch and pulling it.

```bash
git checkout merge-destination-branch
git pull
```

Then move back to the branch you want to merge (origin) and merge the destination branch to your origin.

> We do this to make sure we get the latest changes from the destination branch in our own origin branch.  
> We work on the origin-branch anyway, and now we can resolve any conflicts (if any) without disturbing other developers.
>  
> If we would immediately merge our origin branch into the destination branch,
> any merge conflict would break the build for all developers who pull the destination branch afterwards.

So let's be a good team player and  move the latest version of the destination-branch into our own branch:

```bash
git checkout my-merge-origin-branch
git merge merge-destination-branch
```

If there are any merge conflicts, we now fix them and repeat the procedure (merge-destination-branch might have changed while we fixed any conflict).

If no merge conflicts arise (anymore), we can push your local changes (to our own "my-merge-origin-branch") with `git push`

Afterwards we can "trivial merge" our origin branch into the destination branch.

To do this, we switch to the merge-destination-branch and merge the branch we want to merge into it.
If there are no errors or conflicts, we can then **push** our changes.

```bash
git checkout merge-destination-branch
git merge my-merge-origin-branch
# Only push if there are no conflicts, errors or warnings!
git push
```

This merge and push will make any of your changes immediately active on the remote (server) repository.

This is generally only done for merging feature branches into other feature branches, or sometimes for merging into the **dev** development branch.

For merging into the **main** branch (and some teams prefer doing this for development as well) we generally advise to use a **Pull Request**.

### Example for merging into a development branch

```bash
# let's make sure we have a current copy of 'develop' in our local repository
git checkout develop
git pull
# Let's go to our own branch and apply the latest changes from 'develop' there.
git checkout feature-blinkenlights
git merge develop
# If we have merge conflicts, we need to resolve them
# ...
# Successfully resolved, we can update our (own!) branch:
git push
# Now let's merge our changes onto develop, first we need to make sure it is 'fresh':
git checkout develop
git pull
# If there were no more changes on develop, we now have a "trivial merge":
git merge feature-blinkenlights
# A "trivial merge" means we are sure we will not have any conflicts
# Yay! All good! Let's send our work to the remote server:
git push
```

## Pull requests

**Pull requests (PR's)** are a Git server feature, e.g. they are not built into the core of Git itself, but were added to server systems like
[GitHub](https://www.github.com), [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or other alternatives.

With a **pull request** you ask others to merge your branch into a different branch, giving them the opportunity for a code review of your changes.

In companies or other organizations this is usually the procedure to follow to merge feature branches into dev.

Almost all companies will use such a procedure whenever something is to be merged into important branches like **main** or into a "production" or "release" branch.

## Configuration

One time setup:

```bash
# Assign VSCode as default text editor:
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

# Disable Fast Forward merging:
git config --global merge.ff false
```
