## Een introductie

The term ‘embedded’ is often used, but it doesn’t tell much about the hardware involved. It refers to the way a (computer) system is used, not necessarily to its properties. All types of computers, including PCs, laptops, and single-board computers can be used as embedded systems. Three broad classes of embedded hardware can be identified:

•	PC/Raspberry Pi level hardware, running a general-purpose operating system like Windows or Linux;

•	Single-board computers, often running a real-time Operating System (RTOS);

•	[Micro-controllers](../embedded/microcontroller/Arduino-UNO/README.md), running one application program, without any separate Operating System (bare metal).
