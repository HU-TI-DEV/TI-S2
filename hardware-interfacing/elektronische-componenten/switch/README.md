## Een introductie

A switch is a component that can either conduct current (zero resistance, like a wire) or block current (infinite resistance, as if it were not present at all). The symbol resembles an open bridge. In this circuit the switch is used to switch the LED on or off.

The switches that you will use are pushbutton switches that have four pins. Internally, opposite pins are (always) connected in two pairs. If you press the switch, the two pairs will be connected. If you can’t remember which points are connected (like me): the pins that are diagonally opposite to each other certainly aren’t connected, so use those.

These switches are designed to be used as input to a micro-controller, hence they are rated for a low current, typically a few mA.
