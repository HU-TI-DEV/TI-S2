# Welcome to [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev)!

This is the slidev environment folder. All slidev components are in this folder. The HU template for slidedecks and used images are here. The slides for TI S2 are in the folder /slides. A copy of a slidedeck is only copied here when it is presented. To display a slidedeck run showslides.bat for example:

.\show_slides .\kennissessies\C++_geschiedenis.md

Slidev has Node js and npm dependencies.
